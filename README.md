# Dungon
A little python game.
This is a game that was first created as a teaching exersize by Kenneth Love of Treehouse. He challanged his students to make improvements to the game. This is the result of my improvments.
I added: A weapon, a key for the door that must be found. The monster chases the player. The size of the dungon can be changed with only one edit.
