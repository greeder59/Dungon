These are the directions for playing the Dungon game.
OBJECTIVE:
Find your way out of the dungon while avoiding the hungry monster.
You must find the key to unlock the door, then find the door.
If you find the sword, you can optionaly kill the monster.

YOU:
Are able to move UP, DOWN, LEFT, OR RIGHT unless you are
up against a wall of the dungon. The game will list the
available moves. Type one of the listed moves at the prompt.
If you try to walk through a wall, you will get an error message.
You can also type "quit" to leave the game.

MONSTER (grue):
Will chase you. If it catches you, you lose. If you run into a wall,
the monster will still chase you. If you type an unknown command,
the monster will not move (there is no penalty for fumbling fingers).
If you have a sword, you can kill the monster. Killing the monster is
optional.

SWORD:
There is a sword placed at a random location in the dungon.
If you find it, you can attack the monster and kill it.
To attack the monster, just move toward it. 

KEY:
There is a key placed at a random location in the dungon.
You must find the key or you will not be able to open the
door and escape.

DOOR:
This is your objective. However, you will not be able to
open the door unless you have first found the key. If you 
find the door and don't have the key, you will be told that
the door is locked.
